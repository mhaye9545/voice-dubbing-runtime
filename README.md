> Local, CPU-first voice cloning and speech synthesis runtime with a standalone PySide6 desktop GUI, isolated TTS engines and explicit voice/model license gates.

**Status:** public alpha / active development  
**Target:** Windows x64, Python 3.11, CPU-first  
**First-party code:** Apache-2.0  
**Important:** the current viXTTS/XTTS-v2 model snapshots use separate model terms; open-source code does not automatically grant commercial model or voice rights.

## Why this project?

Voice Dubbing Runtime is being built as a **standalone voice-cloning and dubbing application first**, with a stable runtime contract that other apps can integrate later.

The project focuses on a few practical problems that are often mixed together in one fragile ML environment:

- creating and managing reusable voice profiles;
- selecting short 8–15 second voice references from audio/video;
- optionally separating vocals from background audio with Demucs;
- requiring technical checks **and human listening approval** before a new reference is committed;
- synthesizing speech with multiple TTS engines behind one runtime contract;
- keeping incompatible ML stacks isolated in separate environments/processes;
- exposing a CLI/JSON worker protocol and a thin PySide6 desktop GUI;
- running locally and CPU-first instead of requiring a GPU-first deployment.

The runtime originally grew out of the Voice Dubbing work in FrameExtract Studio, but this repository is intentionally standalone. FrameExtract Studio should integrate later through a stable adapter/protocol rather than becoming a dependency here.

---

## What works today

- Standalone PySide6 GUI in `voice_dubbing_app/`.
- Voice profile create/list/update/delete flows.
- Profile revisions, integrity locks and history.
- Profile-specific voice-rights consent.
- FFmpeg source normalization.
- Automatic or manual 8–15 second reference selection.
- Two-phase reference workflow:
  - `prepare_profile_reference`;
  - `commit_profile_reference` after listening approval and single-speaker confirmation.
- Optional Demucs/htdemucs source separation in an isolated environment.
- `vixtts_vi` CPU runtime for Vietnamese.
- `xtts_v2_multilingual` isolated runtime with a persistent child worker.
- Durable job artifacts and machine-readable `@@VOICE_DUB|` progress markers.
- Safe standalone storage migration from the legacy FrameExtract Studio namespace.
- Windows/Python 3.11 GitHub Actions CI.
- Reproducible dev/CPU bootstrap scripts and a read-only `doctor` command.

### Not released yet

This is still a **public alpha research/development preview**. There is no end-user installer/portable release yet. Before packaged releases, the project still needs manual desktop acceptance, real-model acceptance and clean-machine packaging tests.

A visual GUI demo is tracked in [good first issue #5](https://github.com/akita141188/voice-dubbing-runtime/issues/5).

## Quick start for contributors

### 1. Clone

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/akita141188/voice-dubbing-runtime.git
cd voice-dubbing-runtime
```

### 2. Bootstrap the self-contained dev/GUI/test environment

Python 3.11 x64 is required.

```powershell
& .\scripts\bootstrap_dev.ps1 -PythonExecutable C:\path\to\python.exe
```

If `python` already points to Python 3.11, `-PythonExecutable` can be omitted.

### 3. Run the GUI

```powershell
& .\.venv-dev\Scripts\python.exe -m voice_dubbing_app
```

The GUI is a thin client. Starting it does not silently download or load heavy models.

### 4. Run diagnostics and tests

```powershell
& .\.venv-dev\Scripts\python.exe -m voice_dubbing_runtime doctor --json
& .\scripts\run_tests.ps1
```

### 5. Bootstrap the viXTTS CPU runtime when needed

```powershell
& .\scripts\bootstrap_cpu.ps1 -PythonExecutable C:\path\to\python.exe
```

Model weights are provisioned separately after their own license gates; they are not bundled in the source repository.

                |                                   |
                v                                   v
     .venv-source-separation              persistent child worker
```

The parent runtime intentionally avoids importing every ML dependency into one process. Engine-specific stacks remain isolated behind subprocess adapters.

## Runtime environments

| Purpose | Environment | Main stack |
|---|---|---|
| Dev / GUI / tests | `.venv-dev` | PySide6 + project test/runtime dependencies |
| Vietnamese TTS | `.venv-cpu` | viXTTS, PyTorch CPU, pinned vendored TTS source |
| Multilingual XTTS | `.venv-xtts` | `coqui-tts==0.27.5`, XTTS-v2, PyTorch CPU |
| Source separation | `.venv-source-separation` | Demucs/htdemucs, PyTorch CPU |

Provisioning scripts intentionally keep model download/license acceptance separate from the base bootstrap.

---

## CLI / worker contract

```powershell
& .\.venv-cpu\Scripts\python.exe -u -m voice_dubbing_runtime capabilities --json
& .\.venv-cpu\Scripts\python.exe -u -m voice_dubbing_runtime profiles list --json
& .\.venv-dev\Scripts\python.exe -m voice_dubbing_runtime storage status --json
& .\.venv-dev\Scripts\python.exe -m voice_dubbing_runtime storage migrate --json
& .\.venv-cpu\Scripts\python.exe -u -m voice_dubbing_runtime worker --job <job.json>
& .\.venv-cpu\Scripts\python.exe -u -m voice_dubbing_runtime worker --jobs-jsonl <jobs.jsonl>
```

Current worker actions:

```text
create_profile
prepare_profile_reference
commit_profile_reference
synthesize
```

The runtime uses machine-readable markers prefixed with:

```text
@@VOICE_DUB|
```

---

## Storage and backward compatibility

The canonical standalone Windows data root is:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\VoiceDubbingRuntime\
```

Legacy data under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FrameExtractStudio\VoiceDubbing\` is supported through a copy + SHA-256 verification migration with legacy fallback. The migration does not move, rename or delete the legacy source store.

## Roadmap

Near-term priorities:

1. Add screenshots/demo media and improve first-run UX.
2. Stabilize the public runtime/API surface.
3. Improve reference candidate ranking and quality evaluation.
4. Add dubbing workflow features: segment/subtitle input, batch synthesis, timing adaptation and track assembly.
5. Build a clean Windows packaging/release pipeline.
6. Integrate FrameExtract Studio only after the standalone runtime/API is stable.

The project remains CPU-first and keeps model provisioning separate from the source distribution.
